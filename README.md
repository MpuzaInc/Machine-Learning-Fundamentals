# Machine-Learning-Fundamentals
A repository to help the TVET Curriculum educators to explore some practical concepts in machine learning based on how RTB curriculum structured, This repo will be updated with new Learning outcomes soon, stay checking updates.
# 🧼 1. Data Preprocessing Techniques with Synthetic Data

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates key data preprocessing techniques using a small synthetic dataset. It is designed as a learning tool for Teachers / students and beginners in Machine Learning.

## ✨ Covered Topics
you are welcome to contribute to this repo if you are passionate to help others especially educators
---

## ✨ Covered Topics

- Handling missing data
- Feature encoding:
  - Label Encoding
  - Binary Encoding
  - Target Encoding (with and without smoothing)
- Feature scaling (MinMax Scaler, Standard Scaler)
- Date/time feature extraction and transformation and Cycling encoder( SINUS AND COSINE representation to detect the close betwen DECEMBER(12) AND JANUARY(1))
- Correlation analysis And interpretation
- Normality testing (e.g., Kolmogorov–Smirnov test)
- Dropping irrelevant features
